Styles for PostgreSQL database

These styles can be used with layers from PostgreSQL database which were loaded from OSM using osm2pgsql with osm2pgsql default style file. For more details visit
Wiki https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql
or
GitHub https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql


Styles are prepered to create printed maps in scales about 1:100 000. Styles were made for Poland, so they can bring unexpected results in other countries (especially in administrative boundaries).
